#DataTrained Practice Projects

This Repository contains project done as part of PG Program in Data Science, Machine Learning & Neural Networks in collaboration with IBM. During the course we had to submit a few projects for practice purpose which was before the evaluation phase of the course.. The projects include data cleaning, data wrangling, data preprocessing, data encoding, data visualization, statistical description of data etc. and building a machine learning model according to the problem statement based on the cleaned dataset, training and testing the machine learning model and hyperparameter tuning. The datasets were given by the institution only.
